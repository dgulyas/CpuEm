# CpuEm
Emulator for my teaching CPU

https://github.com/dgulyas/cpu contains a cpu built using logisim as well as an assembly language spec.
Eventually I'll write a toy programming langage that will compile to the assembly language, but in order to build the compiler I want a software emulator to quickly see if the code compiled correctly.

Therefore, this repo contains a software version of the cpu.
